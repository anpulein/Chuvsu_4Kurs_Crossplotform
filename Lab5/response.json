        "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED\n\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\nthat they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.",
        "Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she\nspent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the\nneighbors.",
        "The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.",
        "Mrs.\nPotter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;\nin fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her\nsister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was\npossible to be.",
        "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\nstrange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the\ncountry.",
        "Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for\nwork, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming\nDudley into his high chair.",
        "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,\nbecause Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the\nwalls.",
        "For a second, Mr. Dursley\ndidn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to\nlook again.",
        "Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in\nfunny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people!",
        "Mr. Dursley was\nenraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man\nhad to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak!",
        "But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some\nsilly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...\nyes, that would be it.",
        "The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.\nDursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.",
        "And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...\n\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea.",
        "While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom\nwindow and peered down into the front garden.",
        "His last, comforting\nthought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were\ninvolved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.\nDursley.",
        "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat\non the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness.",
        "If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed\nMrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening\ndown on the pavement.",
        "One small hand closed on the letter beside\nhim and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was\nfamous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs.\nDursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk\nbottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and\npinched by his cousin Dudley...",
        "CHAPTER TWO\n\nTHE VANISHING GLASS\n\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find\ntheir nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at\nall.",
        "The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass\nnumber four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living\nroom, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when\nMr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.",
        "Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\nlarge pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley\nDursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large\nblond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a\ncomputer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.",
        "The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't\nthere -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't\nunderstand them, like a slug.",
        "Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in\nthe back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the\nzoo for the first time in his life.",
        "The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was\njust no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.",
        "The Dursleys had received a very angry letter\nfrom Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school\nbuildings.",
        "If there was one thing the\nDursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking\nabout anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a\ndream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous\nideas.",
        "The\nDursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the\nentrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry\nwhat he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap\nlemon ice pop.",
        "He was careful to\nwalk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who\nwere starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall\nback on their favorite hobby of hitting him.",
        "He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as\nlong as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents\nhad died in that car crash.",
        "When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown\nrelation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the\nDursleys were his only family.",
        "The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt\nPetunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one\nwhere Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things\nthat wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.",
        "Of\ncourse, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys\nhad given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.",
        "He lay and\nwatched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would\nremember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.",
        "\"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over\nthe back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent\nit into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it\ninto a corner of the room.",
        "A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious\nlook Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled\nwith rage.",
        "Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a\nsword, he said, \"I'm warning you, Dursley -I'm warning you -- one more\nword... \"\n\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant,\nUncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the\nwall and fell silent.",
        "If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of\nhumor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything\nHagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help\ntrusting him.",
        "Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the\nDursleys, then handed him an envelope.",
        "Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a\nletter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon,\nHarry.\"",
        "CHAPTER SIX\n\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\n\nHarry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun.",
        "He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure\nhe had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her\ncage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.",
        "Two\nhours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the\nDursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to\nHarry, and they had set off.",
        "He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he\nhad pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many\nMars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars.",
        "He'd never been more\nnervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to\nthe Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue.",
        "The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been\nallowed to eat as much as he liked.",
        "He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did\nSnape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs\nand Fungi?",
        "These fantastic party favors were nothing like the\nfeeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little\nplastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside.",
        "If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to\ngo back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's\nonly dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over\nto the Dark Side!",
        "The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.\nDursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.",
        "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED\n\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\nthat they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.",
        "No one knows why, or how,\nbut they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's\npower somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.",
        "It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the\nname of heaven did Harry survive?\"",
        "He'll be famous -- a\nlegend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day\nin the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child\nin our world will know his name!\"",
        "He bent his\ngreat, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very\nscratchy, whiskery kiss.",
        "\"But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead\n-- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or\nwe'll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly\non the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to\nthe front door.",
        "He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out\nof his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to\nthe other two.",
        "He couldn't know that at this very\nmoment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up\ntheir glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy\nwho lived!\"",
        "Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then\nthe sound of the frying pan being put on the stove.",
        "Harry was used to\nspiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and\nthat was where he slept.",
        "Exactly why Dudley wanted a\nracing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated\nexercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody.",
        "Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry\nhad always been small and skinny for his age.",
        "The only thing Harry\nliked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that\nwas shaped like a bolt of lightning.",
        "About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and\nshouted that Harry needed a haircut.",
        "Harry must have had more haircuts\nthan the rest of the boys in his class put\n\ntogether, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way --\nall over the place.",
        "Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley\nlooked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a\npig in a wig.",
        "Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down\nhis bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.",
        "At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it\nwhile Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a\nvideo camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and\na VCR.",
        "Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had\nbroken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be\na whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and\nTufty again.",
        "The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't\nthere -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't\nunderstand them, like a slug.",
        "\"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to\nwatch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go\non Dudley's computer).",
        "Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in\nthe back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the\nzoo for the first time in his life.",
        "His aunt and uncle hadn't been able\nto think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle\nVernon had taken Harry aside.",
        "\"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up\nclose to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business,\nanything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until\nChristmas.\"",
        "The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was\njust no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.",
        "Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking\nas though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors\nand cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which\nshe left \"to hide that horrible scar.\"",
        "Dudley had laughed himself silly\nat Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day,\nwhere he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.",
        "Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting\nold sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she\ntried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until\nfinally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit\nHarry.",
        "Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to\nhis great relief, Harry wasn't punished.",
        "Dudley's gang had been chasing him as\nusual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was\nsitting on the chimney.",
        "The Dursleys had received a very angry letter\nfrom Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school\nbuildings.",
        "He liked to\ncomplain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the\nbank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects.",
        "He turned right\naround in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet\nwith a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!\"",
        "The\nDursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the\nentrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry\nwhat he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap\nlemon ice pop.",
        "It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they\nwatched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley,\nexcept that it wasn't blond.",
        "They ate in the zoo\nrestaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker\nglory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him\nanother one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.",
        "The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:\nThis specimen was bred in the zoo.",
        "As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,\nhissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.\"",
        "As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except\nsnap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were\nall back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had\nnearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to\nsqueeze him to death.",
        "But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers\ncalming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you,\nHarry?\"",
        "When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown\nrelation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the\nDursleys were his only family.",
        "After asking Harry\nfuriously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the\nshop without buying anything.",
        "The weirdest thing about all these\npeople was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a\ncloser look.",
        "Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated\nthat odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and\nnobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.",
        "CHAPTER THREE\n\nTHE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his\nlongest-ever punishment.",
        "Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang,\nwho visited the house every single day.",
        "This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he\ncould see a tiny ray of hope.",
        "One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings\nuniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's.",
        "She let Harry watch\ntelevision and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though\nshe'd had it for several years.",
        "Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the\nsmell from Harry's new uniform.",
        "Three things\nlay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was\nvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a\nbill, and -- a letter for Harry.",
        "Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax\nseal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake\nsurrounding a large letter H.\n\n\"Hurry up, boy!\"",
        "Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the\nsame heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of\nhis hand by Uncle Vernon.",
        "roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the\nscruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the\nkitchen door behind them.",
        "Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but\nsilent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry,\nhis glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at\nthe crack between door and floor.",
        "Tell them we don't\nwant --\"\n\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the\nkitchen.",
        "That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd\nnever done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.",
        "Harry was\nthinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the\nletter in the hall.",
        "When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice\nto Harry, made Dudley go and get it.",
        "H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'\"\n\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the\nhall, Harry right behind him.",
        "Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the\nground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact\nthat Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.",
        "After a\nminute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the\nSmelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with\nHarry's letter clutched in his hand.",
        "His heart hammered as he crept\nacross the dark hall toward the front door --\n\nHarry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on\nthe doormat -- something alive!",
        "Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the\nbig, squashy something had been his uncle's face.",
        "Uncle Vernon had been\nlying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making\nsure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do.",
        "Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the\ntime he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.",
        "Twenty-four letters to\nHarry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each\nof the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt\nPetunia through the living room window.",
        "Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on\nthe windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and\nwondering....",
        "She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nRoom 17\n\nRailview Hotel\n\nCokeworth\n\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out\nof the way.",
        "If it was Monday -- and you\ncould usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of\ntelevision -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday.",
        "She and Uncle\nVernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find\nthe softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest,\nmost ragged blanket.",
        "The lighted dial of\nDudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat\nwrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time.",
        "Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the\nbeetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.",
        "It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt\nthe warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.",
        "He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted\nanything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the\ngiant.",
        "\"Yeh don' know... yeh don' know...\" Hagrid ran his fingers through his\nhair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.",
        "Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,\naddressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock,\nThe Sea.",
        "Yours sincerely,\n\nMinerva McGonagall,\n\nDeputy Headmistress\n\nQuestions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't\ndecide which to ask first.",
        "With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could\nread upside down:\n\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\n\nGiven Harry his letter.",
        "Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right\nperson ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh can't go off ter\nHogwarts not knowin'.\"",
        "That's what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches\nyeh -- took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even -- but it didn't\nwork on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry.",
        "Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but\nHarry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had\nbeen a horrible mistake.",
        "Now he came to think about it... every odd\nthing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had\nhappened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley's\ngang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going\nto school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow\nback... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his\nrevenge, without even realizing he was doing it?",
        "When he turned\nhis back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in\nhis trousers.",
        "Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak\nfiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.",
        "Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of\nkeys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...\nfinally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.",
        "Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg\nso Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it.",
        "Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to\nbe left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never\nhad so many questions in his life.",
        "Not only was Hagrid twice as\ntall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like\nparking meters and saying loudly, \"See that, Harry?",
        "\"Hagrid,\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \"did you say\nthere are dragons at Gringotts?\"",
        "Hagrid, who didn't understand \"Muggle money,\" as he\ncalled it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.",
        "Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night\nbefore, and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nUNIFORM\n\nFirst-year students will require:\n\n1.",
        "If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of\nhumor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything\nHagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help\ntrusting him.",
        "\"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great\nhand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.",
        "Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry\nfound himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.",
        "\"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand,\n\"c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you.\"",
        "Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them\nthrough the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was\nnothing but a trash can and a few weeds.",
        "\"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus\nTwo Thousand -- fastest ever --\" There were shops selling robes, shops\nselling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen\nbefore, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes,\ntottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion\nbottles, globes of the moon....\n\n\"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid.",
        "Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog\nbiscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward\none of the doors leading off the hall.",
        "I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart,\n\"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\"",
        "They went\nrattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to\ntry to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and\npulled him back by the scruff of his neck.",
        "Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,\nHarry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous\njewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty.",
        "Madam\nMalkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his\nhead, and began to pin it to the right length.",
        "Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing\nat two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.",
        "But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That's you done, my\ndear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy,\nhopped down from the footstool.",
        "Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him\n(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).",
        "Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o'\nduffers, but --\"\n\n\"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff\" said Harry gloomily.",
        "They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts\nwhere the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as\npaving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in\ncovers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with\nnothing in them at all.",
        "Hagrid almost had to drag\nHarry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and\nBefuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs,\nTongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.",
        "Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"It says\npewter on yer list\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing\npotion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope.",
        "While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a\nsupply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself\nexamined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule,\nglittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).",
        "Harry now\ncarried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with\nher head under her wing.",
        "Harry felt strangely as though he had\nentered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that\nhad just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow\nboxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.",
        "\"And that's where...\"\n\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a\nlong, white finger.",
        "Powerful wand, very powerful, and in\nthe wrong hands... well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into\nthe world to do....\"\n\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.",
        "He measured Harry from shoulder to\nfinger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round\nhis head.",
        "Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring\nbetween his nostrils, was doing this on its own.",
        "Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr.\nOllivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.",
        "Try --\"\n\nHarry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was\nsnatched back by Mr. Ollivander.",
        "Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... \"\n\nHe put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,\nstill muttering, \"Curious... curious..\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Harry, \"but what's curious?\"",
        "The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made\ntheir way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through\nthe Leaky Cauldron, now empty.",
        "Harry didn't speak at all as they walked\ndown the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at\nthem on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped\npackages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap.",
        "Up\nanother escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized\nwhere they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.",
        "Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the\nDursleys, then handed him an envelope.",
        "Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a\nletter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon,\nHarry.\"",

        "True, Dudley was now so\nscared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia\nand Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do\nanything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.",
        "Every night before he went to\nsleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned\nto the wall, counting down to September the first.",
        "Two\nhours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the\nDursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to\nHarry, and they had set off.",
        "Harry thought\nthis was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the\nplatforms with a nasty grin on his face.",
        "The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry\ncouldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to\nget annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose.",
        "Getting\ndesperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but\nthe guard said there wasn't one.",
        "Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as\nthe boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large\ncrowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last\nbackpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.",
        "Harry looked behind him\nand saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the\nwords Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.",
        "Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the\nred-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying.",
        "He had already changed into his\nbillowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge\non his chest with the letter P on it.",
        "Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their\nsister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train\nuntil it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.",
        "He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as\nthough he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out\nof the window again.",
        "\"I'd have thought you, of all people --\"\n\n\"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, I\njust never knew you shouldn't.",
        "Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears\nwent pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches.",
        "Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice\nWands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his\nlife.",
        "\"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share\nbefore or, indeed, anyone to share it with.",
        "It was a nice feeling,\nsitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties,\ncakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).",
        "I might get Agrippa -- thanks\n\nHarry turned over his card and read:\n\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\n\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is\nparticularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in\n1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his\nwork on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.",
        "Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that\nDumbledore's face had disappeared.",
        "Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than\nlooking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep\nhis eyes off them.",
        "Harry got toast,\ncoconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was\neven brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't\ntouch, which turned out to be pepper.",
        "There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced\nboy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in.",
        "Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he\nhadn't learned all the course books by heart either.",
        "\"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,\"\nsaid Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses.",
        "He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game\nwhen the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the\ntoadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.",
        "Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was\nthe pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop.",
        "\"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly,\nnoticing where Harry was looking.",
        "\"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because\nCrabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.",
        "Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the\nstudents, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \"Firs' years!",
        "Harry\ncould hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right\n-the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall\nshowed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall.",
        "Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line\nbehind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out\nof the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors\ninto the Great Hall.",
        "Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry\nlooked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars.",
        "Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed\na four-legged stool in front of the first years.",
        "Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,\nthat seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was\nnow staring at the hat, he stared at it, too.",
        "The hat seemed to be asking rather alot;\nHarry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment.",
        "Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\"\nbecame the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded\nwith cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.",
        "Perhaps it was Harry's\nimagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they\nlooked like an unpleasant lot.",
        "Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at\nothers it took a little while to decide.",
        "\"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the\nsandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost\na whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.",
        "\"Moon\" \"Nott\" \"Parkinson\" then a\npair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" and\nthen, at last -- \"Potter, Harry!\"",
        "The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the\nhall full of people craning to get a good look at him.",
        "The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden,\nhorrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.",
        "\"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry\nas \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin.",
        "The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been\nallowed to eat as much as he liked.",
        "\"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry\ncut up his steak,\n\n\"Can't you --?\"",
        "Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost\nsitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained\nwith silver blood.",
        "He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to\nsee, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.",
        "Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you\ncould think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam\ndoughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- \"\n\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their\nfamilies.",
        "On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about\nlessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm\nparticularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something\ninto something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-\";\n\"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of\nthing -- \").",
        "The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's\nturban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across\nthe scar on Harry's forehead.",
        "Harder to shake off was the\nfeeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he\ndidn't like Harry at all.",
        "They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their\nfeet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when\nthey came to a sudden halt.",
        "Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it\ngot heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened\npainfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with\nit -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh\nbecame high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke,\nsweating and shaking.",
        "The people in the portraits kept going to visit\neach other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.",
        "There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out,\nthan waving your wand and saying a few funny words.",
        "At the start of their\nfirst class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he\ngave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.",
        "Harry had gotten used to this by now, but\nit had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a\nhundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast,\ncircling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters\nand packages onto their laps.",
        "This morning, however, she fluttered\ndown between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto\nHarry's plate.",
        "It said, in a very untidy\nscrawl:\n\n\nDear Harry,\n\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have\na cup of tea with me around three?",
        "Hagrid\n\n\nHarry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the\nback of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.",
        "It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because\nthe Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to\nhim so far.",
        "Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and\nlike Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.",
        "Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without\nher leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a\nbezoar was.",
        "As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind\nwas racing and his spirits were low.",
        "\"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a\nlarge teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.",
        "The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their\nteeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told\nHagrid all about their first -lessons.",
        "While Ron\ntold Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a\npiece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.",
        "Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to\nrob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.",
        "As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets\nweighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry\nthought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much\nto think about as tea with Hagrid.",
        "CHAPTER NINE\n\nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL\n\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley,\nbut that was before he met Draco Malfoy.",
        "Harry had caught Ron\nprodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the\nplayers move.",
        "Privately, Harry felt she'd had\ngood reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of\naccidents even with both feet on the ground.",
        "Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that\nMalfoy had been quick to notice, of course.",
        "At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors\nhurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying\nlesson.",
        "Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley\ncomplain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to\nvibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.",
        "Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell\nwhen you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's\nvoice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the\nground.",
        "Harry saw his\nscared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp,\nslip sideways off the broom and --\n\nWHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass\nin a heap.",
        "Malfoy\nonly just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and\nheld the broom steady.",
        "Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he\nleft, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward\nthe castle.",
        "\"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up\nthe corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.",
        "Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape\nin the face for weeks....\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.",
        "Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened\nwhen he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.",
        "\"But first years never -- you must be the youngest\nhouse player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his\nmouth.",
        "\"You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got\nyour little friends with you,\" said Harry coolly.",
        "Catching the look on Harry's\nface, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know,\nwith real wizards.",
        "All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day,\nHarry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus\nfalling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing).",
        "There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or\nMrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another\nschool rule today.",
        "They had almost reached\nthe portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I\ncan't believe you're going to do this, Harry.\"",
        "Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the\nCurse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned\nthem all forward.",
        "Horror-struck, Harry waved madly\nat the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried\nsilently toward the door, away from Filch's voice.",
        "Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to\ncreep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.",
        "Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not\nlooking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the\ndoorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead,\nwithout any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped\nthrough a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled\nalong it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was\nmiles from the trophy room.",
        "It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry\nknew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their\nsudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting\nover that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.",
        "They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they\nalmost flew, back down the corridor.",
        "It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package\nfrom vault seven hundred and thirteen was.",
        "CHAPTER TEN\n\nHALLOWEEN\n\nMalfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were\nstill at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.",
        "Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the\nthree-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite\nkeen to have another one.",
        "In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the\npackage that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and\nthey spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy\nprotection.",
        "Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a\nbossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.",
        "Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in\nthis large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped\nit right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor.",
        "Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\n\n\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.",
        "\"That's a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture\nof jealousy and spite on his face.",
        "\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the\nlook of horror on Malfoy's face.",
        "\"Well, it's true,\" Harry chortled as they\nreached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn't stolen Neville's\nRemembrall I wouln't be on the team....\"\n\n\"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?\"",
        "As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the\ndusk toward the Quidditch field.",
        "They\nreminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle\n\nchildren blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.",
        "Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick\nand kicked off from the ground.",
        "\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\nabout the size of a soccer ball.",
        "Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking\nhis nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around\ntheir heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to\npin it to the ground.",
        "\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the\ngoal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry\nreeled off.",
        "He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\nminutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf\nballs as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.",
        "Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice\nthree evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly\nbelieve it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two\nmonths.",
        "Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which\nwas a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye).",
        "Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the\nfeather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the\ndesktop.",
        "Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and\nset fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.",
        "\"It's no wonder no\none can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the\ncrowded corridor, \"she's a nightmare, honestly. \"",
        "On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast,\nHarry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that\nHermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.",
        "Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell\ncame sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.",
        "As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry\nsuddenly grabbed Ron's arm.",
        "Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old\nsocks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.",
        "Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he\nthrew it as hard as he could against the wall.",
        "The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe\nhitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning\nits ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.",
        "Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward\nthe door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall,\nher mouth open with terror.",
        "Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He\ntook a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the\ntroll's neck from behind.",
        "The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there,\nbut even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its\nnose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it\nhad gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.",
        "Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry\nclinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him\noff or catch him a terrible blow with the club.",
        "On Saturday, Harry would be playing in\nhis first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.",
        "Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as\ntheir secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret.",
        "But the news\nthat he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know\nwhich was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people\ntelling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.",
        "Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\nQuidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup\nmatch in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest\nplayers, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to\nthem; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had\nbeen known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.",
        "Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry\nand Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer\nfor it.",
        "The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them\nwere out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured\nthem up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.",
        "Harry,\nRon, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view;\nthey were sure it wouldn't be allowed.",
        "\"Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that\nSnape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.",
        "He tried to empty his mind\n-- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a\nfew hours -- but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his\nleg wasn't easy to forget.",
        "Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were\nchanging into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing\nin green).",
        "Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his\nknees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.",
        "Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking\nparticularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year.",
        "\"Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin',\" said Hagrid, raising his\nbinoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.",
        "Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection\nfrom one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to\ncome pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry\ndodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.",
        "Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings\nfluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed --\n\nWHAM!",
        "A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint\nhad blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry\nholding on for dear life.",
        "It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously\npast his head, that it happened.",
        "Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts\n-- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he\nrealized that his broom was completely out of his control.",
        "\"If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of\nhis broom... but he can't have....\"\n\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands.",
        "At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of\nlooking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.",
        "The whole crowd was on\nits feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull\nHarry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every time\nthey got near him, the broom would jump higher still.",
        "Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his\nhand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field\non all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.",
        "\"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\" Flint was still howling\ntwenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken\nany rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results --\nGryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty.",
        "Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get\neveryone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing\nHarry as Seeker next.",
        "Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny,\nbecause they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay\non his bucking broomstick.",
        "Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of\nstudents who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up\nat once.",
        "\"I'll get him,\" said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, \"one of\nthese days, I'll get him --\"\n\n\"I hate them both,\" said Harry, \"Malfoy and Snape.\"",
        "\"And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we've got\nhalf an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\"",
        "Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\nanything, but he wasn't very hopeful.",
        "Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time\nto think much about Flamel.",
        "On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next\nday for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.",
        "Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in\nemerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.",
        "Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on\nit, the other a G.\n\n\"Harry's is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry's\nsweater.",
        "Harry pulled a wizard\ncracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like\na cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the\ninside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice.",
        "Harry watched Hagrid\ngetting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine,\nfinally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's\namazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.",
        "When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of\nthings out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous\nballoons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.",
        "The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were\ngoing to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.",
        "Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they\nreturned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in\nhis new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron.",
        "The lamp looked as if it was floating along\nin midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the\nsight gave him the creeps.",
        "He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild\neyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's\noutstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks\nstill ringing in his ears.",
        "They walked straight past, and Harry\nleaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps\ndying away.",
        "His panic\nfading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved\nnearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection\nagain.",
        "She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her\neyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the\nglass.",
        "And slowly, Harry looked into the\nfaces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green\neyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as\nthough he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family,\nfor the first time in his life.",
        "The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at\nthem, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping\nto fall right through it and reach them.",
        "They tried retracing Harry's route from the\nlibrary, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.",
        "Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't\nsee his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.",
        "But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in\nfront of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.",
        "Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to\nget to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.\n\n\"",
        "\"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore,\nand Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.",
        "\"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with\nHarry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of\nthe Mirror of Erised.\"",
        "\"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you\nnot to go looking for it again.",
        "It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore\nmight not have been quite truthful.",
        "CHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\nNICOLAS FLAMEL\n\nDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of\nErised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the\ninvisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk.",
        "\"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said\nRon, when Harry told him about these drearns.",
        "She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being\nout of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had\ncaught you!",
        "They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary\nbook, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere.",
        "Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer\nnightmares when he was tired out after training.",
        "Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for\nnot wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....",
        "The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the\nend of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common\nroom, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess.",
        "Chess was the only\nthing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very\ngood for her.",
        "\"Don't talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to\nhim, \"I need to concen --\" He caught sight of Harry's face.",
        "Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other\ntwo about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.",
        "Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog,\nthe very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas.",
        "Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks\nbefore she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.",
        "She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient\nstudy of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a\nlegendary substance with astonishing powers.",
        "The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down\ndifferent ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still\ndiscussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one.",
        "It\nwasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry\nremembered about Snape and the coming match.",
        "As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous,\nwhatever he told Ron and Hermione.",
        "Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to\nkeep running into Snape wherever he went.",
        "Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had\nthe horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.",
        "Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the\nnext afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever\nsee him alive again.",
        "Harry\nhardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch\nrobes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.",
        "They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were\nready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.",
        "Hermione, who had all her\nfingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was\ncircling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.",
        "Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her\nmouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.",
        "Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as\nHarry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron\nrolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the\nwhirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.",
        "Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see\nsomething scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next\nsecond, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the\nSnitch clasped in his hand.",
        "As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land\nnearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his\nshoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.",
        "Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two\nThousand back to the broomshed.",
        "It was\nalmost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as\nthough he was petrified.",
        "Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and\nHermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was\nstill growling inside.",
        "Whenever Harry passed\nQuirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron\nhad started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.",
        "Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron\nspent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get\nthrough all their extra work.",
        "Harry, who was looking up \"Dittany\" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and\nFungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, \"Hagrid!",
        "\"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said\nHarry, \"about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --\"\n\n\"SHHHH!\"",
        "Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week\nmade Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous.",
        "Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry\nsitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to\nbed.",
        "Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day\nto find Ron in a terrible state in bed.",
        "From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as\nthough the teddy was having his head torn off.",
        "Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the\ncrate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.",
        "UP another\nstaircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the\nwork much easier.",
        "They showed Harry and Hermione the\nharness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.",
        "They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and\nHermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.",
        "Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each\nother around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last.",
        "\"I was\ntrying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to\ncatch you, he said you had a drag --\"\n\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor\nMcGonagall had seen.",
        "Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this\nwasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt.",
        "Poor,\nblundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and\nfind them in the dark, to warn them.",
        "And then\nthe story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter,\ntheir hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points,\nhim and a couple of other stupid first years.",
        "From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school,\nHarry was suddenly the most hated.",
        "Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble\nto lower their voices as they insulted him.",
        "It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not\nto meddle in things that weren't his business from now on.",
        "The rest of the team wouldn't speak\nto Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they\ncalled him \"the Seeker.\"",
        "They didn't have as bad a time\nas Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to\nthem, either.",
        "He, Ron, and Hermione kept to\nthemselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the\ningredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart,\nmemorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions....\n\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new\nresolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put\nto an unexpected test.",
        "All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had\njust left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be\nwalking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given\nin at last.",
        "\"If we just do a bit of poking around --\"\n\n\"No,\" said Harry flatly, \"we've done enough poking around.\"",
        "Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do\nin the furor over the points they'd lost.",
        "\"I'm not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased to hear\nthe note of panic in his voice.",
        "A little way into it they reached a\nfork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left\npath while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.",
        "Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their\nshoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.",
        "Right, we're changin' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an'\nHermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot.",
        "I'm sorry,\" Hagrid\nadded in a whisper to Harry, \"but he'll have a harder time frightenin'\nyou, an' we've gotta get this done.\"",
        "The hooded\nfigure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was\ndribbling down its front.",
        "He\nheard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over\nHarry, charging at the figure.",
        "He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar\nthat stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.",
        "\"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front\nlegs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.",
        "Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had\nto grab his shoulders to stay on.",
        "And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,\nthey plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.",
        "Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of\nlow-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question.",
        "They made\ntheir way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought\nFirenze didn't want to talk to him anymore.",
        "In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as\nHarry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.",
        "\"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\" Harry\nwent on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me\noff... Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy.\"",
        "\"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever\nafraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you.",
        "CHAPTER SIXTEEN\n\nTHROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\n\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to\nget through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting\nthrough the door at any moment.",
        "Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his\nforehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the\nforest.",
        "Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because\nHarry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by\nhis old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there\nwas a hooded figure dripping blood in it.",
        "Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest,\nor because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron\nand Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry.",
        "When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put\ndown their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help\ncheering with the rest.",
        "\"You\ncould look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how\nbadly we've done, there's no need to worry yet.\"",
        "Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was\nsomething he'd forgotten to do, something important.",
        "Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but --\n\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet.",
        "\"Don't you think it's a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy\nslope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and\na stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket?",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they\ncame to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy\nafter the grounds.",
        "\"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor -- it's\nabout the Sorcerer's tone --\"\n\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that.",
        "Harry and Ron went back to\nthe common room, Harry had just said, \"At least Hermione's on Snape's\ntail,\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came\nin.",
        "As for Harry and Ron, their legs\nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.",
        "\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he\njoined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.",
        "\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis --\n'there's no wood,' honestly.\"",
        "Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into\nthe ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.",
        "Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry\nstreaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and\nwith a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one\nhand.",
        "I suppose we've got to take the\nplace of three of the black pieces....\"\n\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think.",
        "Finally he said,\n\"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at\nchess --\"\n\n\"We're not offended,\" said Harry quickly.",
        "\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90\nnext to him instead of that castle.\"",
        "The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a\nknight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces\nand walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron,\nand Hermione took.",
        "With\none last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through\nthe door and up the next passageway.",
        "\"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they\nstepped carefully over one of its massive legs.",
        "Harry\nlooked over her shoulder to read it:\n\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\n\nTwo of us will help you, which ever you would find,\n\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead,\n\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead,\n\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine,\n\nThree of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.",
        "Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was\nsmiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.",
        "I'll be far away by the\ntime he gets back....\"\n\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him\nfrom concentrating on the mirror.",
        "And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come\nfrom Quirrell himself\n\n\"Use the boy... Use the boy...\"\n\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.",
        "It winked and put the Stone back in its\npocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his\nreal pocket.",
        "\"I have strength enough... for this....\"\n\nHarry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot.",
        "Where there\nshould have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most\nterrible face Harry had ever seen.",
        "At\nonce, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as\nthough it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his\nmight, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him.",
        "shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged,\nknocking Harry clean off his feet' landing on top of him, both hands\naround Harry's neck -- Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain,\nyet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.",
        "And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go\nof his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see\nthey looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.",
        "Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by\ninstinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face --\n\n\"AAAARGH!\"",
        "Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:\nQuirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible\npain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough\npain to stop him from doing a curse.",
        "Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the\npain in Harry's head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only\nhear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, \"KILL HIM!",
        "\"I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's\ngone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --\"\n\n\"Call him Voldemort, Harry.",
        "Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his\nreturn to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to\nfight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed\nagain, and again, why, he may never return to power.\"",
        "Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,\nwhich gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet.",
        "When he had found\nhis voice again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak - do you know\nwho sent it to me?\"",
        "Then he could go back to\nhating your father's memory in peace....\"\n\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he\nstopped.",
        "Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was\nglad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.",
        "\"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried\n--\"\n\n\"The whole school's talking about it,\" said Ron.",
        "Ron and Hermione were a\nvery good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry\ntold them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.",
        "\"I brought Ron round --\nthat took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact\nDumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he\njust said, 'Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?'",
        "said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and\nremorse, great tears leaking down into his beard.",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and\ncheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people\nhugging him.",
        "Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who\ncouldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the\nBody-Bind Curse put on him.",
        "He caught Harry's eye\nand Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed\none jot.",
        "It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at\nQuidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would\nnever, ever forget tonight.",
        "It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking\nfurious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station\nfull of ordinary people."
